# myAndroidApp
I made this using MIT App Inventor 2 (yes I know, I agree, block-based programming is stupid, but it's the best I have since I'm and a school chromebook and the native file editor is crap).  This is me using it to learn how to better make real apps.  
I decompiled it using http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk which looks a little sketchy but was probably made by someone who knows more about java than javascript.  (and other stuff obviously but that sounded cool)
